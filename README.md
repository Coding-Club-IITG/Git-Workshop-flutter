***Once you clone the repository make sure to create a Firebase app and do the relevant things (i.e. registering the app on Firebase, downloading json file from Firebase console and so on. If you take up a issue which can be solved without doing the Firebase stuff then you can commit by fixing that bug itself. I have tried to not get into the mess of setting up Firebase as much as possible for these issues.
All the Best!***
